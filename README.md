# Cyclist Bike-Share:Case Study
Project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate

## Intoduction and Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

### About the company
 In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.

## Phase 1: Ask

The director of marketing and manager Lily Moreno has set a clear goal to design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.I'm assisgned with crating insights to answer the following questions:

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Phase 2: Prepare
The data that we will be using is Cyclist's historical trip data from the last 12 months in this case (July-2021 to June-2022). The data has been made available by Motivate Internation Inc.(https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html)under this licnese(https://ride.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement)

The data is organized by 12 CSV files (each for a month) with 13 columns and more than 5 million rows

In order to protect the privacy of the customers, any personal information such as credit number and adresses are being omitted. 

The ROCCC approach is used to determine the crediblity of the data
* Reliable – It is complete and accurate and it represents all bike rides taken in the city of Chicago for the selected duration of our analysis.
* Original - The data is made available by Motivate International Inc. which operates the city of Chicago’s Divvy bicycle sharing service which is powered by Lyft.
* Comprehensive - the data includes all information about ride details including starting time, ending time, station name, station ID, type of membership and many more.
* Current – It is up-to-date as it includes data until end of June 2022
* Cited - The data is cited and is available under Data License Agreement.

## Phase 3: Process
The tools that I will be using for the process phase is R Programming. R is very useful to handle huge datasets efficiently.
